# App Development Cost Estimate

This [blog post](https://yalantis.com/blog/cost-of-mobile-messaging-app-development-types-kpis-landscape-recommended-approach-and-cost-of-development/) led to the following cost estimates (using mean values) for the chat portion of GameChat:

|    Phase     |    (hours)       |
| ------------ |:----------------:|
| Design       |              115 |
| Front-end    |              585 |
| Back-end     |              640 |
| Maintenance  |             4020 |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Total Hours: |             5360 |
| Total Cost   | @$100/hr -> $536K |

The first three phases lead up to the Alpha Test milestone.  The maintenance phase consists of all development during and after Alpha test and uses the well accepted 75% metric: the split between development and maintenance costs is 1/4.


# Revenue Estimate

The revenue model is conservative and based on a tiny market penetration (one ten-thousandth of 1%) with a life-span of 20 years (most good softare has a 30 year life-span and a much higher market penetration).

* Market: 1.5B Users
* Target: 0.0001% Penetration/Year @ 5$/year -> $75K/year
* Life: 20 years -> $1.5 Million

A reasonable but still conservative estimate is 1% market penetration over 30 years, which yields a staggering $2.25 Billion.
