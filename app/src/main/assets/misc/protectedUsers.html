<h2>What is a Protected User?</h2>
<p>
    A protected user allows GameChat access to a child or other person who does not have an online presence.

<h3>GameChat Users</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Standard User:</u> A user who logs in to GameChat using Google, Facebook or email credentials, which are used to track the user's GameChat experiences and chat.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Chaperone:</u> A standard user who creates a protected user becomes that protected users <i>chaperone</i>. The chaperone account is the only account that can
        manage their protected users.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Protected User:</u> A special type of restricted user which has limited functions (and presumably no online presence).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating a Protected User</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A protected user account is created by a standard user.</li>
    <li>The email address can be fake.
    <br>The protected user does not need to have a valid e-mail address, although GameChat will ask you to specify an email address when you create the
    protected user. <i><b>Wait, what?</b></i> Yes, GameChat will use this "email address" as a means to track the protected user's
    chat and game experiences and to make sure that no other accounts can access them. The email address does not have to be valid (we will never send
    email to the address), and in fact we suggest that it is <i>not</i> valid, which will help your protected user stay below the Internet radar.
    </li>
    <li>When creating a protected user, the chaperone selects one or more groups for the protected user to access.</li>
    <li>To complete the creation of the protected user account, GameChat will log in to the protected user account.</li>
</ul>
