    You can use GameChat to chat and play games with friends and family. When playing a game, you can
    use chat features to communicate with other uses and mentor and teach someone else the game. For
    example, you can teach a child or a grandchild to play chess.

    GameChat is automatically updated across multiple devices, so you can start a game or conversation
    on one device, such as a tablet, and continue it on another, such as your smartphone.
