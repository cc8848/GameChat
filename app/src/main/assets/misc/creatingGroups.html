No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come, but condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of manÂ¹s recorded history in a time span of but a
half-century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of
animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only five years ago man
learned to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year, and then less than two months ago,
during this whole 50-year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power.

Newton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week did we develop
penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before
midnight tonight.
<p>
This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems, new dangers. Surely the opening
vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward.
