Privacy Policy

1. Sharing data

We never share your data with anyone.

2. Storing data

GameChat only stores the data it needs to function properly and to continuously improve the customer experience by using data to detect and resolve bugs, find out where GameChat is used to provide localization support and to detect which features are enjoyed.

Cloud Chats
GameChat is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your chats on Google Cloud (Firebase) servers, so that you can have excellet access to your data from any of your devices anytime and use our instant server search to quickly access your messages. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.

Secret Chats
Secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.

Media in Secret Chats
When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient. He can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of GameChat’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.

Contacts
GameChat uses phone numbers as unique identifiers, so that it is easy for you to switch from other messaging apps (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.

We store your contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for GameChat and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.

Your e-mail address
When you enable 2-step-verification for your account, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code, if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.

3. Deleting data

Accounts
If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the account management page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your messages, experiences and contacts. This action must be confirmed via your GameChat account and cannot be undone.

Messages
Everything you delete is deleted forever.

When you delete a message, you delete it from your message history. This means that a copy still stays on the server as part of your partner‘s message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it’s gone forever. GameChat is a non-commercial project and we value the disk space on our servers greatly.
